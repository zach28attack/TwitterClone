ðŸ“– This app is completed. 

I challenged myself with this project. I came into it with only a basic understanding of how to create basic CRUD apps. 
I learned a variety of things such as:
  - image uploading using the Shrine gem
  - polymorphic associations 
  - "reposting"
  - added search functionality using the Ransack gem
  - custom css
    - css grid
    - flexbox
    
Just to name a few.
Overall this project was extremely beneficial for me and i'm excited to start another.
